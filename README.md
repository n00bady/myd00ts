# myd00ts
Learning to use git/github by uploading and maintaining my dot files. :)


Things needed to use this config in its fullest (for now, I will update the README.md if there are any new changes).

	i3blocks
	i3lock
	compton
	feh
	
	gtk theme: arc-maia-dark
	icons: arc-maia
	terminal: xfce4-terminal
	
	
The distro I use is Manjaro and at the current setup is running on virtualbox until I deem it ready.
